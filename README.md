Pathfinder Spell Card Project

A project to create nice looking spell cards for pathfinder spells. Currently sourced on the spell database found at the [Pathfinder Community Site](http://www.pathfindercommunity.net/home/databases/spells)

Currently just loads a csv version of the CSV and makes a dict keyed on spell name. Also some crappy unit tests.
